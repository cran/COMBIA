Description: A comprehensive synergy/antagonism  analyses of drug combinations with
    quality graphics and data. The analyses can be performed by Bliss independence and Loewe
    additivity models. COMBIA provides improved statistical analysis and makes only very weak assumption of data variability 
    while calculating bootstrap intervals (BIs). Finally, package saves analyzed data, 
    2D and 3D plots ready to  use in research publications. COMBIA does not require manual
    data entry. Data can be directly input from wetlab experimental platforms 
    for example fluostar, automated robots etc. One needs to call a single function only  
    to perform all analysis (examples are provided with sample data).
