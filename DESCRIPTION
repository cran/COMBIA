Description: A comprehensive synergy/antagonism analyses of drug combinations with 
		quality graphics and data. The analyses can be performed by Bliss 
		independence and Loewe additivity models. 'COMBIA' provides improved 
		statistical analysis and makes only very weak assumption of data 
		variability while calculating bootstrap intervals (BIs). It is based
		on heteroscedasticity controlled resampling (bootstrapping) and includes
		a global (omnibus) test. Finally, package saves analyzed data, 2D and 3D
	 	plots ready to use in research publications. 'COMBIA' does not require manual
		data entry. Data can be directly input from wetlab experimental platforms for
	 	example fluostar, automated robots etc. One only needs to call a single function, 
		analyzeCOMBO(), to perform all analysis (examples are provided with sample data).
